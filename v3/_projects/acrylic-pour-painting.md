I found acrylic pour painting during the pandemic. I needed something to pass the time besides being on my computer all day long. I ultimately enjoyed the process just as much as the results. I like being inspired by some color in real live and think of how to create the color or which colors would complement it. Next, I'm no illustrator so I needed something where I didn't have to be so technical or precise. Pour painting still allows for creativity through tools and additives. And if I didn't like it I would just paint over it and try again.

Below are some examples of the pieces I've made.
