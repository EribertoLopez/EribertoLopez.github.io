__Software Engineering Manager/Lead__	Strateos, Inc\.	*Menlo Park, CA*	__07/2022 \- Current__

Enable enterprise users to plan experiments, command\-and\-control robotic execution, securely capture proprietary data, and visualize real\-time execution history from remote or on\-site devices\.

- Lead an internal team of 7 and third\-party offshore development team as the tech lead for the workflows domain\. 
- Enriched telemetry of workflow domain services using Fluentbit to forward metrics and API logs to SumoLogic\. Enabled developers to query for cluster environment specific logs, leading to faster incident resolution and development\.
- Optimized front\-end React components by migrating to a MobX bi\-directional stage\-management approach, leading to a 53% reduction in workflow builder front\-end total load time\.
- Led the architectural transition and deployment of the frontend application to a CDN based infrastructure\.

__Senior Software Engineer__	Strateos, Inc\.	*Menlo Park, CA*	__12/2021 \- 07/2022__

Scaled Strateos’ legacy scientific intent execution system from lambda functions to microservice architecture\.

- Led the design and development of enterprise level microservice applications of Workflows domain, offering scientists a platform to execute complex workflows on shared infrastructure while safeguarding proprietary data\. Full\-stack service applications used React, GraphQL, Python, Flask, Java, Springboot, and Postgres deployed onto EKS using ArgoCD\.
- Streamlined data ingestions pipelines for both web and robotic domains, reducing complexity and enhancing monitoring of raw data capture\. Migrated data and software from Heroku cloud to AWS cloud infrastructure\.

__Software Engineer III__	Strateos, Inc\.	*Menlo Park, CA*	__08/2019 \- 12/2021__

Developed and maintained features and scientific intent schemas that are device agnostic and reproducibly executed

- Achieved 64x increase in cloud lab sample throughput by optimizing computer vision and robotic commands, specifically for genetic isolate identification\. Presented innovative use case and proof of concept at the [SynBioBeta Conference 2020](https://app.swapcard.com/event/synbiobeta-2020-the-global-synthetic-biology-conference/planning/UGxhbm5pbmdfMTU0NzM5), subsequently leading to multiple client contracts ranging from $100k to $1M\.
- Developed Python statistical software to automate cluster identification of multidimensional data, significantly reducing the hands\-on quality control validation time for operational teams by 50%\.
- Curator of open\-source machine readable scientific intent schemas, [*autoprotocol\.org*](https://autoprotocol.org/)* & *[*autoprotocol\-py*](https://github.com/autoprotocol/autoprotocol-python/graphs/contributors)

__Research Engineer II__	University of Washington	*Seattle, WA*	__07/2017 \- 08/2019__

<a id="_Int_sn6uRFn3"></a>Klavins Lab DARPA grant used to automate remote execution of the design, build, and test cycle for genetic systems\.

- <a id="_Int_Z7CTLPc5"></a>Enabled [Synergistic Discovery and Design DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/program/synergistic-discovery-and-design) stakeholders to remotely design, build, and test genetic CRISPR systems, provided real\-time access to results and significantly reduced experimental iterations\.
- Developed a Python client to facilitate ETL processes, extracting and loading data from remote labs to Texas Advanced Computing Center's HPCs\. Contributed to experimental intent schema used by DARPA remote labs\.
- Integrated Klavins Lab scientific devices with web application \(Ruby on Rails, Angular\) and AWS cloud resources\. Developed [High Throughput Culturing workflow](https://github.com/klavinslab/Aquarium-High-Throughput-Culturing) with web app and made it accessible to stakeholders\.
- Co\-authored algorithmic design of thousands of non\-repetitive synthetic parts for genetic systems in microbes\.
