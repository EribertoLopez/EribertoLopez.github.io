To the Invitae Production Team Hiring Manager:

I am writing to express my interest in the Bioinformatics Engineer position at Invitae\. I am classically trained as a biologist and have 5\+ years of synthetic biology research and development in both academic and private domains\. My software engineering experience stems from the need to analyze large amounts of scientific data across multiple experiments to test experimental genetic combinatorial spaces\. Recently, I have been inspired to use my experience to automate and build data driven methods to speed up scientific discoveries\.

My past role, as a Research Scientist in the Klavins Lab at the University of Washington gave me a platform to develop my vision for automating cellular and molecular high throughput screens\. In collaboration with the DARPA Synergistic Discovery and Design program, I developed an automated High Throughput Culturing workflow and a RNASeq workflow on the *Aquarium *platform, a cloud laboratory ruby on rails application\. Standardizing the data output from the experiment and creating an ETL pipeline to load the data into databases found at the Texas Advanced Computing Center in Austin, TX\. During my time in the Klavins lab I learned how to containerize and scale my workflow in order for it to be deployed in other laboratories\. Currently, my workflows are being deployed in the University of California Santa Barbara in Dr\. Enoch Yeung’s lab and at Duke University in Dr\. Steve Hasse’s lab\. 

Furthermore, I used my established workflows in novel ways by providing an algorithmic interface for genetic parts discovery\. In collaboration with the Ayaan Hossain from the Salis lab at Penn State, we used my workflows to implement Massively Parallel Reporter Assays, measuring RNA expression fold increases, to characterize algorithmically generated synthetic yeast genetic parts\. This publication showed me that my skill set can provide biologically flexible software solutions to other bioengineers and speed up discoveries of the scientific community\.

Currently, at Strateos I generate user stories from biotechnology clients and implement their workflows on the Strateos Cloud Laboratory Environment \(SCLE\)\. Using cloud infrastructure enables me to help clients increase experimental throughput, accuracy, and precision\. In addition, I extend the workflow through an ETL data analysis pipeline in order to internally quality control experiments and align with client ingesting data pipelines\. 

Today, as biotechnology research moves towards digitalization, the genetic search space becomes broader but reachable with new techniques and technologies\. I am enticed to apply modern tools and statistical methods to Invitae’s rich datasets for personalized medical applications\. I hope to use my biological domain knowledge and expanding software engineering skills to be an effective part or your team\. Thank you for your time and consideration\. I look forward to discussing my experience and qualifications with you and the Invitae team\.

Sincerely,

Eriberto Lopez
