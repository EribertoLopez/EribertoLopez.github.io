__Senior Software Engineer__	Strateos, Inc\.	*Remote*	__12/2021 \- 07/2024__

Enable enterprise users to plan experiments, command\-and\-control robotic execution, securely capture proprietary data, and visualize real\-time execution history from remote or on\-site devices\.

- Migrated core monolith features to microservice architecture\. Reduced deployment time, reduced system up\-time latency, increased fault isolation, and increased team productivity\. Standardized backend technologies to Java, Springboot, Python, and FastAPI\.
- Developed OpenAPI codegen devtools to generate server, client, and type schema library code used across microservices\. Decoupled various domain schemas to libraries to reduce redundant de/serialization code across microservices\.
- Optimized front\-end React components by migrating to a MobX bi\-directional stage\-management approach, leading to a 53% reduction in workflow builder front\-end total load time\.
- Led the design and development of enterprise level microservice applications in Workflows domain, offering scientists a platform to execute complex workflows on shared infrastructure while safeguarding proprietary data\. Full\-stack service applications used React, GraphQL, Python, Flask, Java, Springboot, and Postgres deployed onto EKS using ArgoCD\.

__Software Engineer III__	Strateos, Inc\.	*Menlo Park, CA*	__08/2019 \- 12/2021__

Designed & maintained device\-agnostic scientific intent schemas and features, ensuring reproducible execution in workcell

- Achieved 64x increase in cloud lab sample throughput by optimizing computer vision and robotic commands, specifically for genetic isolate identification\. Presented innovative use case and proof of concept at the [SynBioBeta Conference 2020](https://app.swapcard.com/event/synbiobeta-2020-the-global-synthetic-biology-conference/planning/UGxhbm5pbmdfMTU0NzM5), subsequently leading to multiple client $100k\+ contracts\. 
- Developed Python statistical software to automate viable cell cluster identification of multidimensional flow cytometry data, significantly reducing the hands\-on quality control validation time for operational teams by 50%\.
- Curator of open\-source machine readable scientific intent schemas, [*autoprotocol\.org*](https://autoprotocol.org/)* & *[*autoprotocol\-py*](https://github.com/autoprotocol/autoprotocol-python/graphs/contributors)
- Streamlined data ingestion pipelines for both web and robotic domains, reducing complexity and enhancing monitoring of raw data capture\. Migrated data and software from Heroku cloud to AWS cloud infrastructure\.
- Scaled Strateos’ legacy scientific intent execution system from lambda functions to microservice architecture\.

__Research Engineer II__	University of Washington	*Seattle, WA*	__07/2017 \- 08/2019__

<a id="_Int_sn6uRFn3"></a>Klavins Lab DARPA grant used to automate remote execution of the design, build, and test cycle for genetic systems\.

- <a id="_Int_Z7CTLPc5"></a>Enabled [Synergistic Discovery and Design DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/program/synergistic-discovery-and-design) stakeholders to remotely design, build, and test genetic CRISPR systems, provided real\-time access to results and significantly reduced experimental iterations\.
- Developed a Python client to facilitate ETL processes, extracting and loading data from remote labs to Texas Advanced Computing Center's HPCs\. Contributed to experimental intent schema used by DARPA remote labs\.
- Integrated Klavins Lab scientific devices with [web application](http://klavinslab.org/aquaverse/) \(Ruby on Rails, Angular\) and AWS cloud resources\. Developed [High Throughput Culturing workflow](https://github.com/klavinslab/Aquarium-High-Throughput-Culturing) with web app and made it accessible to stakeholders\.
- Teach, guide, and advise undergraduate research assistants through cellular & molecular experiments and software development\.
