# Notable Projects

## Robotic Cloud Lab Platform — Strateos, Inc.

**Role:** Software Engineering Manager / Senior Software Engineer | **Duration:** 2019–2024

Led development of the industry's first robotic cloud lab platform, enabling enterprise scientists to plan experiments, command-and-control robotic execution, securely capture proprietary data, and visualize real-time execution history.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Migrated core monolith features to microservice architecture using Java, SpringBoot, Python, FastAPI, React, and GraphQL, deployed onto EKS using ArgoCD.
- Developed OpenAPI codegen devtools to generate server, client, and type schema library code used across microservices.
- Optimized front-end React components by migrating to a MobX bi-directional state-management approach, reducing workflow builder total load time by 53%.
- Built Python statistical software for automated viable cell cluster identification of multidimensional flow cytometry data.
- Curator of open-source machine readable scientific intent schemas at autoprotocol.org and autoprotocol-py.

**Impact:**
- Achieved 64x increase in cloud lab sample throughput by optimizing computer vision and robotic commands for genetic isolate identification.
- Presented at SynBioBeta Conference 2020, leading to multiple client $100k+ contracts.
- Reduced hands-on quality control validation time for operational teams by 50%.
- Boosted team velocity by 38% and achieved 83% sprint completion rate as Engineering Manager.
- Filed patent: "Systems and Methods For Processing Experimental Workflow at a Remote Laboratory" — Application No. 63/217,893.
