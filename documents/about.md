## Professional Experience

### Software Engineering Manager — Strateos, Inc., Menlo Park, CA (7/2022 – 7/2024)

Led the industry's first robotic cloud lab platform, providing scientists with an intuitive no-code planner to capture measurements, sample history, and decision making.

- Led internal team of 5 and third-party offshore development team for the workflows domain.
- Boosted team velocity by 38% through enhancements in average story points per developer.
- Achieved 83% sprint completion rate over the last year.
- Spearheaded process changes to optimize Internal Support Channel triaging. Increased engineer volunteering rate by 113%.
- Reduced workflow builder front-end total load time by 53% by migrating to a MobX bi-directional state-management approach.
- Used Jira and Slack APIs and automation to improve developer velocity and accountability.

### Senior Software Engineer — Strateos, Inc., Remote (12/2021 – 7/2022)

Enabled enterprise users to plan experiments, command-and-control robotic execution, securely capture proprietary data, and visualize real-time execution history from remote or on-site devices.

- Migrated core monolith features to microservice architecture. Reduced deployment time, reduced system up-time latency, increased fault isolation, and increased team productivity. Standardized backend technologies to Java, Springboot, Python, and FastAPI.
- Developed OpenAPI codegen devtools to generate server, client, and type schema library code used across microservices. Decoupled various domain schemas to libraries to reduce redundant de/serialization code across microservices.
- Increased robotic throughput by 64x by improving computer vision and robotic commands used to identify genetic isolates. Presented innovative use case and proof of concept at the SynBioBeta Conference 2020, subsequently leading to multiple client $100k+ contracts.
- Contributed to migration and design strategy from self-hosted lambda to distributed workflow engine architecture.
- Unified data ingestion pipeline for web and robotic platforms.
- Filed patent for "Systems and Methods For Processing Experimental Workflow at a Remote Laboratory" — Application No. 63/217,893.

### Software Engineer III — Strateos, Inc., Menlo Park, CA (8/2019 – 12/2021)
