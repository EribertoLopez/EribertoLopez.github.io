# Frontend Development Rules

## Context

Before making frontend changes, read:

- `codegen/openapi.yaml` for API contract and types
- `frontend/generated/` for generated client usage patterns
- `scripts/auto-set-api-url.sh` for how the API URL is set in local dev

## Constraints

**CRITICAL:**

- Do not edit files under `frontend/generated/` — they are generated
- Do not hardcode API base URLs; use `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (set by `scripts/auto-set-api-url.sh` when using `npm run start:local`)

**IMPORTANT:**

- Use the generated API client and models from `frontend/generated/` for backend calls
- Use ShadCN/Radix UI components where available (Button, Dialog, Input, etc., as in `frontend/components/`)

**PREFERRED:**

- Next.js App Router under `frontend/app/`; env vars for the browser must be `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`
- Run the frontend after `start:local` has set the API URL
