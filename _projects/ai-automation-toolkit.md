## Why This Matters

AI tools are most powerful when they integrate seamlessly into existing workflows. These projects explore practical applications of LLMs for personal productivity — not as novelty demos, but as daily-driver tools.

The goal isn't to replace thinking, but to reduce friction between intention and action.
