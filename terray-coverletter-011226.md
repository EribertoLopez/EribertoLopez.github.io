To the Sr\. Software Engineer, Informatics Hiring Manager:

I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer, Informatics role at Terray Therapeutics\. My background sits at the intersection of software engineering, laboratory automation, and data infrastructure\. I have spent my career building systems that translate complex experimental workflows into reliable, scalable software platforms\.

Most recently, as a Lead Software Engineer at Hispanic Scholarship Fund, I own platform\-wide technical design and execution across cloud infrastructure, frontend & backend systems, and data workflows\. I architect and operate event\-driven production systems on AWS, design robust data pipelines and APIs, and validate performance and scalability through load testing and operational metrics\. While the domain differs, the core challenges like reliability, throughput, observability, and maintainability of data centric systems are directly aligned with informatics engineering\.

Previously at Strateos, I worked in a laboratory automation environment designing and maintaining distributed workflow systems that connected scientific intent with cloud\-controlled laboratory execution\. I built and optimized pipelines, microservices, and user\-facing tools used by scientists, and partnered closely with research, product, and automation teams to ensure software solutions reflected real experimental constraints\.

Earlier in my career as a Research Scientist at the University of Washington on DARPA funded research, I designed and built software that enabled scientists to capture and formalize their design of experiments intent for high\-throughput cellular experimentation workflows and downstream RNA\-sequencing assays\. The platform enabled DARPA stakeholders across the country to design experiments and execute them remotely in Seattle, producing structured, well annotated experimental data\. This data was purpose built for downstream machine learning and AI workflows, supporting analysis, modeling, and hypothesis generation, and ultimately contributed to multiple peer\-reviewed publications\.

What draws me to Terray is its AI native, closed\-loop approach to drug discovery, where high\-throughput experimentation, high quality data, and machine intelligence are deeply integrated\. Building software that directly accelerates scientific learning, scales experimental insight, and transforms complex laboratory workflows into reliable, data\-driven systems aligns closely with how I approach engineering and the impact I want my work to have\.

I look forward to discussing my experience\. Thank you for your time and consideration\.

Sincerely,

Eriberto Lopez
