__Lead Engineer__	HSF	*Hybrid*	__1/2025 \- Present__

- Planned, architected, and delivered two major products in 8 months, collaborating with product and executive leaders to define scope\.
- __Broadcast\-Center:__ Architected and delivered a highly scalable, event\-driven messaging system enabling SMS/voice campaigns to 200k\+ recipients per campaign, with real\-time status tracking and fault\-tolerant delivery\.
- Built an analytics dashboard showing delivery and failure rates over 7/30/90\-day windows, with visibility into scheduled campaigns for execution\. Helps users understand failures and reduce costs for subsequent campaigns\.
- Empowered users to adjust campaign strategies based on delivery insights, contributing to a reduction in Twilio reported message failure rates from 24% to 8%\. Resulting in cost savings by lowering failure SMS/voice charges\.
- __Fund\-A\-Scholar \(FAS\):__ Full\-stack crowdfunding web app enabling donors to directly fund ~10,000 underfunded students\.
- Designed infrastructure, backend APIs, and frontend UI\. Integrated __Stripe payments __and implemented __DB \+ Redis locks __to prevent overfunding and double\-spend race conditions\.
- Built a data pipeline to ETL opted\-in scholar data into FAS services, joining application form data with photos and loading DB\.
- Automated image processing by resizing and applying AWS Rekognition to detect and crop student photos for consistent display\.

__Senior Software Engineer__	Strateos, Inc\.	*Remote*	__12/2021 \- 07/2024__

Enable enterprise users to plan experiments, command\-and\-control robotic execution, securely capture proprietary data, and visualize real\-time execution history from remote or on\-site devices\.

- Led architecture of workflow builder products, integrating Python, FastAPI, React, and Postgres on AWS EKS with ArgoCD\.
- Migrated core monolith features to microservice architecture\. Reduced deployment time, reduced system up\-time latency, increased fault isolation, and increased team productivity\. Standardized backend technologies to Java, Springboot, Python, and FastAPI\.
- Developed OpenAPI codegen devtools to generate server, client, and type schema library code used across microservices\. Decoupled various domain schemas to libraries to reduce redundant de/serialization code across microservices\.
- __Data Engineering with Pandas:__
- Analyzed time\-series data from robotic experiments using Pandas for QC, anomaly detection, and device calibration validation\.
- Generated visualizations with Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn to communicate insights to stakeholders and external clients\.

__Software Engineer III__	Strateos, Inc\.	*Menlo Park, CA*	__08/2019 \- 12/2021__

Designed & maintained device\-agnostic scientific intent schemas and features, ensuring reproducible execution in workcell

- Achieved 64x increase in cloud lab sample throughput by optimizing computer vision and robotic commands, specifically for genetic isolate identification\. Presented innovative use case and proof of concept at the [SynBioBeta Conference 2020](https://app.swapcard.com/event/synbiobeta-2020-the-global-synthetic-biology-conference/planning/UGxhbm5pbmdfMTU0NzM5), subsequently leading to multiple client $100k\+ contracts\. 
- Developed Python statistical software to automate viable cell cluster identification of multidimensional flow cytometry data, significantly reducing the hands\-on quality control validation time for operational teams by 50%\.
- Curator of open\-source machine readable scientific intent schemas, [*autoprotocol\.org*](https://autoprotocol.org/)* & *[*autoprotocol\-py*](https://github.com/autoprotocol/autoprotocol-python/graphs/contributors)
- Streamlined data ingestion pipelines for both web and robotic domains, reducing complexity and enhancing monitoring of raw data capture\. Migrated data and software from Heroku cloud to AWS cloud infrastructure\.

__Research Engineer II__	University of Washington	*Seattle, WA*	__07/2017 \- 08/2019__

<a id="_Int_sn6uRFn3"></a>Klavins Lab DARPA grant used to automate remote execution of the design, build, and test cycle for genetic systems\.

- <a id="_Int_Z7CTLPc5"></a>Enabled [Synergistic Discovery and Design DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/program/synergistic-discovery-and-design) stakeholders to remotely design, build, and test genetic CRISPR systems, provided real\-time access to results and significantly reduced experimental iterations\.
- Developed a Python client to facilitate ETL processes, extracting and loading data from remote labs to Texas Advanced Computing Center's HPCs\. Contributed to experimental intent schema used by DARPA remote labs\.
- Integrated Klavins Lab scientific devices with [web application](http://klavinslab.org/aquaverse/) \(Ruby on Rails, Angular\) and AWS cloud resources\. Developed [High Throughput Culturing workflow](https://github.com/klavinslab/Aquarium-High-Throughput-Culturing) with web app and made it accessible to stakeholders\.
- Teach, guide, and advise undergraduate research assistants through cellular & molecular experiments and software development\.
