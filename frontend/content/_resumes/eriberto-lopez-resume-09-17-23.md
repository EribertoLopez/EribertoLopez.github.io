- Boosted team velocity by 38% through enhancements in average story points per developer, coupled with an 83% sprint completion rate over the last year\.
- Streamlined incident triaging processes, by improving team accountability for respective components\. Resulted in a 113% increase in engineer volunteering rates\. Escalation process allowed SMEs to spread knowledge and stay in flow\.
- Spearheaded and incorporated data\-driven initiatives into quarterly roadmaps, significantly reducing tech debt and improving the user experience\. Achieved a 53% reduction in workflow builder front\-end total load time\.

12/2021 – 7/2022__* *__	__*Senior Software Engineer*__		*Strateos, Inc\., Remote*

Scaled Strateos’ legacy scientific intent execution system from lambda functions to microservice architecture\.

- Spearheaded the development of a workflow execution system, offering scientists a platform to execute complex CWL workflows on shared infrastructure while safeguarding proprietary data\. Full\-stack service applications used React, GraphQL, Python, Flask, Java, Springboot, and Postgres deployed onto AWS Kubernetes \(EKS\) cluster using ArgoCD\.
- Streamlined data ingestion pipelines for both web and robotic domains, reducing complexity and enhancing monitoring of raw data capture\. Migrated data and software from Heroku cloud to AWS cloud infrastructure\.
- Contributor in filed patent for “Systems and Methods For Processing Experimental Workflow at a Remote Laboratory” Application No\. 63/217,893\.
- Optimized front\-end React components by migrating to a MobX bi\-directional stage\-management approach\. Significantly reduced latency effects, minimized unnecessary re\-renders, and streamlined codebase\.

8/2019 – 12/2021	__*Software Engineer III *__			*Strateos, Inc\., Menlo Park, CA*

Developed and maintained features and scientific intent schemas that are device agnostic and reproducibly executed\.

- Achieved 64x increase in cloud lab sample throughput by optimizing computer vision and robotic commands, specifically for genetic isolate identification\. Presented innovative use case and proof of concept at the [SynBioBeta Conference 2020](https://app.swapcard.com/event/synbiobeta-2020-the-global-synthetic-biology-conference/planning/UGxhbm5pbmdfMTU0NzM5), subsequently leading to multiple client contracts ranging from $100k to $1M\.
- Developed Python statistical software to automate cluster identification of multidimensional data, significantly reducing the hands\-on quality control validation time for operational teams by 50%\. 
- Curator of open\-source machine readable scientific intent schemas, [*autoprotocol\.org*](https://autoprotocol.org/)* & *[*autoprotocol\-py*](https://github.com/autoprotocol/autoprotocol-python/graphs/contributors)
