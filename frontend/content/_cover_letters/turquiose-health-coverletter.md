To the Senior Software Engineer, AI Hiring Manager:

I’m excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer role on the AI team at Turquoise Health\. I’m motivated by building high impact systems that other teams depend on, and Turquoise’s mission to eliminate financial opacity in healthcare deeply resonates with both my professional interests and personal experience\.

In my current role, I led the design and delivery of an AI guided document verification system that replaced a costly, slow, and manual review process touching a core product workflow\. The system serves roughly 150,000 users each year, each submitting multiple documents containing sensitive PII, and was built to dramatically reduce user wait times while lowering operational cost and security risk\. We used an LLM to interpret non\-standard, unstructured documents from many institutions, while keeping the surrounding workflow deterministic and auditable\. I was deliberate about where AI was appropriate and where it wasn’t\. Preserving human escalation paths for low confidence cases and edge conditions rather than fully automating decision making\.

Bringing this system into production required careful attention to observability, cost, and failure modes\. I implemented human\-in\-the\-loop fallbacks, clear reprocessing rules, and logging to inspect and analyze model outputs over time\. Before launch, I modeled usage to forecast Bedrock costs and budgeted accordingly to avoid surprises at scale\. The result was near instant feedback for users, significantly reduced manual review effort, improved security by limiting PII access, and a system that other teams later adopted for additional document heavy use cases\.

Beyond AI specific work, I’ve consistently focused on building internal platforms with stable, reusable interfaces\. I architected an event\-driven Twilio messaging system used across marketing, operations, HR, and scholarship program teams\. Furthermore, I provided accessible analytics dashboards that exposed delivery failures and materially changed internal behavior\. Ultimately lowering messaging failure rates and costs\. In these systems, I emphasize clear API contracts, schema validation, versioning, and error semantics so other engineers can safely depend on the platform as it evolves\.

Turquoise’s mission is personally meaningful to me\. I’ve seen firsthand how difficult it is to make informed healthcare decisions without cost transparency while supporting my mother through breast cancer treatment\. The ability to use modern AI systems to reduce information asymmetry and help families make better decisions at vulnerable moments is exactly the kind of work I want to be doing\. I’d be honored to bring my experience building reliable, production grade AI systems to the Turquoise team\.

Thank you for your time and consideration\. I’d love the opportunity to discuss how my experience could support Turquoise Health’s goals\.

Sincerely,

Eriberto Lopez
