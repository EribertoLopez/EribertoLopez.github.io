To the Lead Software Developer Hiring Manager:

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Lead Software Developer position at Bio\-Rad's Irvine office\. With over eight years architecting cloud\-based scientific applications and a unique background bridging software engineering and biotechnology, I am excited to contribute to Bio\-Rad's life science research and clinical diagnostics innovation\.

As Lead Engineer at Hispanic Scholarship Fund, I architect secure, cloud\-native AWS systems serving hundreds of thousands of users\. I designed Broadcast\-Center, an event\-driven messaging platform using EventBridge, SQS, Lambda, Aurora RDS, ECS, and S3 that delivers campaigns to over 200,000 recipients per campaign with real\-time tracking\. The system implements secure VPC architecture with private subnets, least\-privilege IAM policies, and compliant PII handling\. I built analytics dashboards views into app, providing delivery insights across multiple time windows for data\-driven decision\-making\. I also architected Fund\-A\-Scholar, a full\-stack crowdfunding platform with Stripe integration, transaction integrity safeguards, and role\-based IAM policies across RDS, SQS, ValKey, S3, and AWS Rekognition services\.

My scientific expertise distinguishes me from other candidates\. At Strateos, I led architecture for no\-code workflow builders enabling researchers to command robotic equipment and visualize experimental data in real\-time\. I managed five developers while migrating from monolith to microservices using Java SpringBoot and Python FastAPI\. At University of Washington's Klavins Lab, I enabled DARPA stakeholders to remotely design, build, and test CRISPR systems by integrating scientific devices with web applications and AWS infrastructure\.

This combination of software leadership and scientific domain knowledge allows me to bridge technical and research stakeholders, a critical capability for Bio\-Rad's multidisciplinary environment\. I excel at translating scientific requirements into technical specifications, establishing coding standards, mentoring teams, and making architectural decisions balancing innovation with reliability\. My publications in Synthetic Biology and Nature Biotechnology, plus my Master's in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, demonstrate my commitment to advancing both fields\.

I am eager to leverage my biological expertise and software engineering leadership to contribute to your team\. I look forward to discussing how my background can drive Bio\-Rad's continued innovation\. Thank you for your time and consideration\.

Sincerely,

Eriberto Lopez

Please answer the questions below in detail:	  

Can you describe a time when you had to define and enforce architectural or design standards across a team? How did you ensure consistency and buy\-in from developers?	

When I joined Hispanic Scholarship Fund as Lead Engineer, the organization was at a pivotal architectural transition\. We had a monolith serving both external scholarship applicants and internal staff tools, and were preparing to create a separate admin portal to house internal products\. This greenfield opportunity presented the perfect moment to establish Infrastructure\-as\-Code \(IaC\) and cloud governance standards\.

I led the architectural design for our internal products infrastructure through stakeholder interviews and collaborative whiteboard sessions with IT, Data Engineering, and Cybersecurity\. We decided to consolidate all future internal products under a single VPC where they could share services and clusters, improving resource efficiency while requiring more robust logging and observability patterns\. The key challenge was that every new service needed consistent configuration to access the VPC and shared resources, which could either streamline development or create repetitive boilerplate across teams\.

I proposed a dual approach, a centralized infrastructure repository provisioning all shared services \(RDS, ElastiCache, ALB configurations\), and a reusable CDK constructs library that abstracted VPC access and resource connections\. Rather than mandating adoption through policy, I demonstrated value by building Fund\-A\-Scholar, the first internal product, using this new architecture\. I walked developers through the implementation, showing how the library reduced greenfield project setup from ~1\-2 days of infrastructure configuration to under an hour, with automatic uniform tagging for cost tracking and compliance documentation\.

This approach seem to resonate with the team and they began to abstract more constructs into the library\. In retrospectives the team seemed to agree that it cut down on overhead and boilerplate\. Over the last 6 months we have had more proof of concept and experiments that have made their way into our products due to the ease of spinning up an application\. The patterns we established are now the foundation for how HSF builds and deploys all internal tooling, enabling faster development cycles while maintaining security and governance standards across the organization\.

“Tell us about a cloud\-based application you designed and built using AWS\. Which services did you leverage \(e\.g\., DynamoDB, Aurora, SQS\), and why did you choose them for that use case?	

One cloud\-based system I designed and implemented is Broadcast\-Center, an event\-driven messaging platform at the Hispanic Scholarship Fund\. The system enables users to configure and schedule voice calls and SMS campaigns through Twilio, delivering messages to over 200,000 recipients per campaign with real\-time status tracking and analytics\.

Stakeholders required that users could schedule campaigns up to two months in advance while maintaining reliability under large recipient loads\. To meet this, I designed a scheduling system using EventBridge Bus and Scheduler\. When a campaign is scheduled, an API call creates a timed event that triggers an EventBridge rule, which batches recipient data stored in S3 and spins up ECS tasks to process the messages\. Choosing ECS was key to handling long\-running jobs without timeouts and ensuring we could saturate Twilio’s message queues efficiently while respecting their rate limits, which vary by channel \(SMS vs\. voice\)\.

Because Twilio’s status callbacks arrive asynchronously, I implemented a webhook endpoint that validates Twilio’s signature headers and enqueues verified messages into SQS\. This prevented spoofed requests and allowed us to batch\-process and deduplicate out of order status updates before writing to the database\. This reduced redundant writes and ensured accurate status records\.

At the data layer, the platform’s APIs are built with API Gateway, Lambda, and Aurora Postgres, providing ACID compliant persistence for campaign and delivery data\. This architecture allowed us to maintain transactional integrity across complex operations while scaling cost\-effectively\.

Using load testing tools, we found that the system could reliably handle ~200k recipients per campaign\. Over the time the platform has been live we have seen a reduction of Twilio failure rates go from 24% to 8%\.

“This role requires strong experience in GoLang, \.NET, Python, and Angular\. Which of these have you used most extensively in production systems, and how have you approached working across multiple tech stacks within the same project?	

I’ve used Python/\(FastAPI, Flask\) and Java/SpringBoot most extensively in production, with frontend work in TypeScript/React\. While I haven’t had as much production experience with Go or \.NET, I’ve successfully led multi\-stack projects and standardized integrations across languages\. I have implemented academic projects with \.NET using C\# to create state machines in my AI courses\.

How I approach working across multiple tech stacks with in the same project is by preferring a contract\-first design approach\. I like to define and document the service boundaries by using OpenAPI/REST\. At Strateos & HSF I implemented an OpenAPI codegen pipeline to generate server stubs and clients across languages, removing friction and preventing protocol drift\. Next, I try to extract common domain scheams into a versioned library or package so teams in different languages can import definitions\.

Finally, I would also look into containerizing different parts of the same projects if they need to communicate\. 

Can you share an example of how you mentored a junior developer or helped elevate the technical standards of a team? What specific outcomes or improvements resulted from your guidance?	

At Strateos, our engineering team had grown quickly, and code quality and review consistency started to vary between projects\. Junior developers were producing good work but needed more structured guidance and feedback loops\. As a Software Engineering Manager, I set out to raise our technical standards and create a repeatable process for mentorship, collaboration, and code quality\.

I implemented a Jira automation that automatically created pull\-request review tasks when a story moved to “Code Review\.” This allowed me to pair junior and senior developers systematically and better track mentorship and velocity metrics\. To align standards, I launched frontend and backend guilds where engineers met to agree on coding conventions, testing practices, and deployment strategies\. I introduced pull\-request checklists and automated CI checks \(linting, test coverage, and schema validation\) to catch issues early and make code reviews more consistent\. I also standardized OpenAPI and schema versioning across microservices, which reduced cross\-service integration errors and clarified ownership boundaries\.

These changes produced tangible improvements shown by, team velocity increasing by 38%, and our sprint completion rate reached 83% over the following year\. Code reviews became faster and more consistent, onboarding time for new engineers dropped, and the guild structure fostered stronger collaboration and cross\-training across the organization\.
