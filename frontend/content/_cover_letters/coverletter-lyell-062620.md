To the Lyell Software Team Hiring Manager:

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Engineer position at Lyell Immunopharma\. I am classically trained as a biologist and have 5\+ years of synthetic biology research and development in both academic and private domains\. My software engineering experience stems from the need to analyze large amounts of scientific data across multiple experiments to test experimental genetic combinatorial spaces\. Recently, I have been inspired to use my experience to automate and build data driven methods to speed up scientific discoveries\.

My past role, as a Research Scientist in the Klavins Lab at the University of Washington gave me a platform to develop my vision for automating cellular and molecular high throughput screens\. In collaboration with the DARPA Synergistic Discovery and Design program, I developed an automated High Throughput Culturing workflow and a RNASeq workflow on the *Aquarium *platform, a cloud laboratory operating system\. Standardizing the data output from the experiment and creating an ETL pipeline to load the data into supercomputers found at the Texas Advanced Computing Center in Austin, TX\. During my time in the Klavins lab I learned how to containerize and scale my workflow in order for it to be deployed in other laboratories\. Currently, my workflows are being deployed in the University of California Santa Barbara in Dr\. Enoch Yeung’s lab and at Duke University in Dr\. Steve Hasse’s lab\. 

Furthermore, I used my established workflows in novel ways by providing an algorithmic interface for genetic parts discovery\. In collaboration with the Ayaan Hossain from the Salis lab at Penn State, we used my workflows to implement Massively Parallel Reporter Assays, measuring RNA expression fold increases, to characterize algorithmically generated synthetic, yeast genetic parts\. This project showed me that my skill set can provide biologically flexible software solutions to other bioengineers and speed up discoveries of the scientific community\.

Currently, at Strateos I am automating a mammalian transfection workflow for gene therapy applications\. Using flow cytometry to characterize the effect of viral vectors on experimental cell lines\. Working towards building an ETL pipeline that identifies clusters of cellular populations and identifying how that cluster is changing based on the independent variable\.

Today, as biotechnology research moves towards digitalization, the genetic search space becomes broader but reachable with new techniques and technologies\. I am enticed to apply modern tools and statistical methods to Lyell’s rich datasets and combine other data types to draw conclusions for personalized medicine applications\. I hope to use my biological domain knowledge and expanding software engineering skills to be an effective part or your team\. Thank you for your time and consideration\. I look forward to discussing my experience and qualifications with you and the Lyell Software team\.

Sincerely,

Eriberto Lopez
