To the Scientific Platforms Team Hiring Manager:

I am deeply interested in the Engineering Manager role at Recursion, where my extensive background in synthetic biology research and software development aligns with your groundbreaking work\. With over five years in synthetic biology across academic and industry settings and four years developing software solutions for complex biological data analysis, I am poised to contribute significantly to your mission\.

At the University of Washington's Klavins Lab, I honed my skills in automating high\-throughput screening processes, significantly advancing the DARPA Synergistic Discovery and Design program\. My collaboration with Penn State's Salis lab led to innovative approaches in genetic component discovery, underlining my commitment to leveraging software for scientific advancements\.

At Strateos, I am currently working on engineering cloud infrastructure and applications to automate and structure scientific experiments\. We enable organizations to capture their scientific intent and transform it into a deterministic machine readable schema that can be executed on the Strateos robotic platform\. We provide a centralized UI for operators and researchers to plan, execute, and analyze their experimental workflows\. It empowers our user to scale the throughput of their experiment, reduce hands on time, and generate data that feed into data pipelines and data driven applications\.This experience has prepared me to contribute effectively to Recursion's objectives, particularly in harnessing digitalization to expand biotechnological research frontiers\.

As biotechnology research moves towards digitalization, the genetic search space becomes broader but reachable with new techniques and technologies\. I am excited about the prospect of applying my skills to Recursion's dynamic environment, contributing to synthetic biology and personalized medicine advancements\. I hope to use my biological domain knowledge and expanding software engineering skills to be an effective part or your team\. Thank you for your time and consideration\. I look forward to discussing my experience and qualifications with you and the Recursion Scientific Platorm team\.

Sincerely,

Eriberto Lopez
